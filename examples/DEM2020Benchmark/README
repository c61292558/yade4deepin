1/ The scripts in this folder were prepared as part of a benchmark exercise inspired by discussions at DEM8 Conference. The subfolder "original" contains the scripts used for the original benchmark comparison and will not receive updates. The other scripts are more recent and may be customized in various ways.

2/ They need to be ran with yade version release 01/2021 or later (version yadedaily on debian/ubuntu)
    $ apt update
    $ apt install yadedaily
    $ source path/to/runAll.sh
   The output per-job can be found in ./outputData. More synthetic outputs will be in current folder (one graph per case + a single file with timings for all jobs).
    
3/ Please find inspiration for other command line execution in 'runAll.sh' and in preambles of the example scripts

4/ Execution time ranges from ~1h to couple days depending on the script and the number of threads. You can track
 progress by checking the generated *.png files, they are updated continuously during simulation.
 
5/ Alternatively, run with graphical interface (needs X server available) and inspect the 3D view (close it when done to not add overhead)
