The postprocessing directory contains subdirectories categorized as per target of postprocessing. Example subdirectories:

* image
* txt
* vtk

Some of the postprocessing methods are general in the sense that they produce useful results in python. In this case there is no direct
target of postprocessing. These should be in directories similar to ``pkg/*`` directory structure. Hence more example subdirectories:

* dem
* pfv
