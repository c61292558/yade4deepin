**Base recorders**

	Base recorders save the geometry (unstructured or structured grids) on which other data is defined. They are implicitly activated by many of the other recorders. Each of them creates a new file (or a block, if :yref:`multiblock <VTKRecorder.multiblock>` is set).

	``spheres``
		Saves positions and radii (``radii``) of :yref:`spherical<Sphere>` particles.
	``facets``
		Save :yref:`facets<Facet>` positions (vertices).
	``boxes``
		Save :yref:`boxes<Box>` positions (edges).
	``lsBodies``
		Exports :yref:`LevelSet` shaped bodies in global frame, after mapping to current positions and orientations their :yref:`grid<LevelSet.lsGrid>` with :yref:`distance fields<LevelSet.distField>`. A Python function (to use within Paraview) is provided at :ysrc:`examples/levelSet/pvVisu.py` for helping bodies' surfaces rendering in Paraview.
	``intr``
		Store interactions as lines between nodes at respective particles positions. Additionally stores on interactions (the :yref:`geom<Interaction.geom> must be of type :yref:`NormShearPhys`) the signed magnitude of normal force (``forceN``) and the component-wise absolute value of shear force (``absForceT``).

**Generic recorders**

	Generic recorders do not depend on specific model being used and save commonly useful data.

	``id``
		Saves id's (field ``id``) of spheres; active only if ``spheres`` is active.
	``mass``
		Saves masses (field ``mass``) of spheres; active only if ``spheres`` is active.
	``clumpId``
		Saves id's of clumps to which each sphere belongs (field ``clumpId``); active only if ``spheres`` is active.
	``colors``
		Saves colors of :yref:`spheres<Sphere>` and of :yref:`facets<Facet>` (field ``color``); only active if ``spheres`` or ``facets`` are activated.
	``mask``
		Saves groupMasks of :yref:`spheres<Sphere>` and of :yref:`facets<Facet>` (field ``mask``); only active if ``spheres`` or ``facets`` are activated.
	``materialId``
		Saves materialID of :yref:`spheres<Sphere>` and of :yref:`facets<Facet>`; only active if ``spheres`` or ``facets`` are activated.
	``coordNumber``
		Saves coordination number (number of neighbours) of :yref:`spheres<Sphere>` and of :yref:`facets<Facet>`; only active if ``spheres`` or ``facets`` are activated.
	``velocity``
		Saves linear and angular velocities of spherical particles as Vector3 and length(fields ``linVelVec``, ``linVelLen`` and ``angVelVec``, ``angVelLen`` respectively``); only effective with ``spheres``.
	``force``
		Saves force and torque of :yref:`spheres<Sphere>`, :yref:`facets<Facet>` and :yref:`boxes<Box>` as Vector3 and length (norm); only active if ``spheres``, ``facets`` or ``boxes`` are activated.
	``pericell``
		Saves the shape of the cell (simulation has to be periodic).
	``bstresses``
		For :yref:`spheres<Sphere>` (if activated) and while considering the per-particle stress tensors as given by :yref:`bodyStressTensors<yade.utils.bodyStressTensors>`, saves the per-particle principal stresses, sigI (most tensile) $\geq$ sigII $\geq$ sigIII (most compressive), and the associated principal directions dirI, dirII, dirIII.

**Specific recorders**

	The following should only be activated in when appropriate engines/contact laws are in use, otherwise crashes can occur due to violation of type presuppositions.

	``cpm``
		Saves data pertaining to the :yref:`concrete model<Law2_ScGeom_CpmPhys_Cpm>`: ``cpmDamage`` (normalized residual strength averaged on particle), ``cpmStress`` (stress on particle); ``intr`` is activated automatically by ``cpm``
	``wpm``
		Saves data pertaining to the :yref:`wire particle model<Law2_ScGeom_WirePhys_WirePM>`: ``wpmForceNFactor`` shows the loading factor for the wire, e.g. normal force divided by threshold normal force.
	``jcfpm``
		Saves data pertaining to the :yref:`rock (smooth)-jointed model<Law2_ScGeom_JCFpmPhys_JointedCohesiveFrictionalPM>`: ``damage`` is defined by :yref:`JCFpmState.tensBreak` + :yref:`JCFpmState.shearBreak`; ``intr`` is activated automatically by ``jcfpm``, and :yref:`on joint<JCFpmPhys.isOnJoint>` or :yref:`cohesive<JCFpmPhys.isCohesive>` interactions can be vizualized.
	``cracks``
		Saves other data pertaining to the :yref:`rock model<Law2_ScGeom_JCFpmPhys_JointedCohesiveFrictionalPM>`: ``cracks`` shows locations where cohesive bonds failed during the simulation, with their types (0/1  for tensile/shear breakages), their sizes (0.5*(R1+R2)), and their normal directions. The :yref:`corresponding attribute<Law2_ScGeom_JCFpmPhys_JointedCohesiveFrictionalPM.recordCracks>` has to be activated, and Key attributes have to be consistent.
	``moments``
		Saves data pertaining to the required corresponding attribute:yref:`acoustic emissions model<Law2_ScGeom_JCFpmPhys_JointedCohesiveFrictionalPM.recordMoments>`: ``moments`` shows locations of acoustic emissions, the number of broken bonds comprising the acoustic emission, the magnitude.
	``thermal``
		Saves temperature of bodies computed using Yade's :yref:`ThermalEngine`.
	``liquid``
		Saves the liquid volume associated with :yref:`capillary models<Law2_ScGeom_ViscElCapPhys_Basic>`.
	``cohfrict``
		Saves interaction information associated with :yref:`the cohesive frictional model<Law2_ScGeom6D_CohFrictPhys_CohesionMoment>`, including isBroken, unp, and breakType.
	``SPH``
		Saves sphere information associated with Yade's SPH module.
	``deform``
		Saves interaction information associated with Yade's deformation module.
	``lubrication``
		Saves lubrications stress from :yref:`LubricationPhys`. ``spheres`` must be active.
	``partialsat``
		Saves suction and radii changes of spheres associated with :yref:`PartialSatClayEngine`. ``spheres`` must be active.
	``hertz``
		Saves bond data from hertzmindlin such as displacement or 'broken' where broken follows a displacement criteria set by user in :yref:`Law2_ScGeom_MindlinPhys_Mindlin`.
