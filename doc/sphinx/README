Generating yade documentation
===============================

This documentation is built as part of the build process with target 'doc' (make doc).

Alternatively, the script yadeSphinx.py in this folder can be executed for one specific output format, see below.
The last option is to patch some latex output from the earlier commands before compiling the *.tex files. 

$ yade -x yadeSphinx.py latex
$ yade -x yadeSphinx.py epub
$ yade -x yadeSphinx.py html
$ yade -x yadeSphinx.py workaround

It is of course possible to build only one format.
The outupts will be in the _build folder.
The latex version (Yade.tex) is to be processed with xelatex (rather than latex).
