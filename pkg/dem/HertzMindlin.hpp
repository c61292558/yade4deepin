=== HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF MINDLIN ===

Mindlin is a set of classes to include the Hertz-Mindlin formulation for the contact stiffnesses.
The DMT formulation is also considered (for adhesive particles, rigid and small bodies).

				R"""(Calculate physical parameters needed to obtain the normal and shear stiffness values according to the Hertz-Mindlin formulation (no slip solution).\\

There are two available viscous damping models for (1) constant and (2) velocity-dependent coefficient of restitution. In both cases, the viscous forces are calculated as $F_{n,viscous}=c_n \cdot v_n$ ($F_{s,viscous}=c_s \cdot v_s$), where $c_n$ ($c_s$) the normal (shear) viscous damping coefficient and $v_n$ ($v_s$) the normal (shear) component of the relative velocity.\\

(1) Constant coefficient of restitution: The normal (shear) viscous damping coefficient is given by $c_n=2 \cdot \beta_n \cdot \sqrt{m_{bar} \cdot k_n}$ ($c_s=2 \cdot \beta_s \cdot \sqrt{m_{bar} \cdot k_s}$),  where $m_{bar}$ the effective mass, $\beta_n$ ($\beta_s$) normal (shear) viscous damping ratios, and $k_{n}=2 \cdot E^* \cdot \sqrt{R^* \cdot \u_N}$ ($k_{s}=8 \cdot G^* \cdot \sqrt{R \cdot u_N}$) the normal (shear) tangential stiffness values, according to the formulations of Hertz and Mindlin, respectively, and $R^*$, $E^*$, $G^*$ the effective radius, elastic and shear moduli of the interacting particles.

The normal (shear) viscous damping coefficient $c_n$ ($c_s$) can be specified either by providing the normal (shear) viscous damping ratio $\beta_n$ ($\beta_s$), which is then assigned directly to :yref:`MindlinPhys.betan` (:yref:`MindlinPhys.betas`), or by defining the normal (shear) coefficient of restitution $e_n$ ($e_s$) in which case the viscous damping ratios are computed using formula (B6) of [Thornton2013]_, written specifically for the Hertz-Mindlin model (no-slip solution) where the end of contact is considered to take place once the normal force is zero and not once the overlap is zero, thus not allowing attractive elastic forces for non-adhesive contacts, as also discussed in [Schwager2007]_.

(2) Velocity-dependent coefficient of restitution: The viscous damping coefficients are given by $c_n=c_s=A \cdot k_n$, where $A$ a dissipative constant. To calculate this constant, the user has to provide a coefficient of restitution ($e_n$) and an impact velocity ($v_n$) corresponding to this $e_n$, as described in [Mueller2011]_.

The following rules apply:
# It is an error to specify both $e_n$ and $\beta_n$ ($e_s$ and $\beta_s$) or both $v_n$ and $\beta_n$.

# If neither $e_n$ nor $\beta_n$ is given, then :yref:`MindlinPhys.betan` will be zero and no viscous damping will be considered.

# If neither $e_s$ nor $\beta_s$ is given, the value of :yref:`Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_MindlinPhys.en` is used for :yref:`Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_MindlinPhys.es` and the value of :yref:`MindlinPhys.betan` is used for :yref:`MindlinPhys.betas`, respectively.

The $e_n$, $\beta_n$, $e_s$, $\beta_s$, $v_n$ are :yref:`MatchMaker` objects; they can be constructed from float values to always return constant values.
