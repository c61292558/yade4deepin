An algorithm is used that recursively evaluates the signed distance function $\phi$ (:yref:`LevelSet.distField`) at increasingly finer mesh sizes to compute the overlap volume $V$. Surface nodes are obsolete if this functor is used. Denoting $u_n$ as the :yref:`overlap<VolumeGeom.penetrationVolume>`, $\vec{C}$ the :yref:`contact point<VolumeGeom.contactPoint>` and $\vec{n}$ the contact :yref:`normal<VolumeGeom.normal>`, we have:

* $u_n = V_n = \sum_i V_i(\vec{x}_i)$
* $\vec{n} = \frac{ \sum_i V_i \vec{\nabla} \phi_1(\vec{x_i}) - \sum_i V_i \vec{\nabla} \phi_2(\vec{x_i}) }{2V_n}$  chosen to be oriented from :yref:`1<Interaction.id1>` to :yref:`2<Interaction.id2>`
* $\vec{C} = \frac{1}{V_n} \sum_i \vec{x}_i * V_i(\vec{x}_i)$

.. note:: Because this functor expresses the particle overlap $u_n$ as a volume, care needs to be taken that only volume-based contact laws are used. Current contact laws in YADE mainly use the overlap distance to determine the force.
