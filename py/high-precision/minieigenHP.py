"""
When yade uses high-precision number as ``Real`` type the usual (old):

.. code-block:: python

	from minieigen import *

has to be replaced with:

.. code-block:: python

	from yade.minieigenHP import *

This command ensures backward compatibility between both. It is then guaranteed that python uses the same number of decimal places as yade is using everywhere else.

Please note that used precision can be very arbitrary, because ``cpp_bin_float``
or ``mpfr`` take it as a :ref:`compile-time argument <highPrecisionReal>`. Hence such ``yade.minieigenHP`` cannot be separately precompiled as a package.
Though it could be precompiled for some special types such as ``boost::multiprecision::float128``.

The ``RealHP<n>`` :ref:`higher precision<higher-hp-precision>` vectors and matrices can be accessed in python by using the ``.HPn`` module scope. For example::

	import yade.minieigenHP as mne
	mne.HP2.Vector3(1,2,3) # produces Vector3 using RealHP<2> precision
	mne.Vector3(1,2,3)     # without using HPn module scope it defaults to RealHP<1>

"""

# all C++ functions are accessible now:
import yade
from yade._minieigenHP import *
