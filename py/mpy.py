'''
This module defines mpirun(), a parallel implementation of run() using a distributed memory approach. Message passing is done with mpi4py mainly, however some messages are also handled in c++ (with openmpi).

.. note:: Many internals of the mpy module listed on this page are not helpful to the user. Instead, please find :ref:`introductory material on mpy module<mpy>` in user manual.


Logic:
------

The logic for an initially centralized scene is as follows:

1. Instanciate a complete, ordinary, yade scene
2. Insert subdomains as special yade bodies. This is somehow similar to adding a clump body on the top of clump members
3. Broadcast this scene to all workers. In the initialization phase the workers will:

	- define the bounding box of their assigned bodies and return it to other workers
	- detect which assigned bodies are virtually in interaction with other domains (based on their bounding boxes) and communicate the lists to the relevant workers
	- erase the bodies which are neither assigned nor virtually interacting with the subdomain

4. Run a number of 'regular' iterations without re-running collision detection (verlet dist mechanism). In each regular iteration the workers will:

	- calculate internal and cross-domains interactions
	- execute Newton on assigned bodies (modified Newton skips other domains)
	- send updated positions to other workers and partial force on floor to master

5. When one worker triggers collision detection all workers will follow. It will result in updating the intersections between subdomains.

6. If enabled, bodies may be re-allocated to different domains just after a collision detection, based on a filter. Custom filters are possible. One is predidefined here (medianFilter)

Rules:
------

	- intersections[0] has 0-bodies (to which we need to send force)
	- intersections[thisDomain] has ids of the other domains overlapping the current ones
	- intersections[otherDomain] has ids of bodies in _current_ domain which are overlapping with other domain (for which we need to send updated pos/vel)

Hint:
------

handle subD.intersections with care (same for mirrorIntersections). subD.intersections.append() will not reach the c++ object. subD.intersections can only be assigned (a list of list of int)

def runOnSynchronouslPairs(workers, command):
	'''
	Locally (from one worker POV), this function runs interactive mpi tasks defined by 'command' on a list of other workers (typically the list of interacting subdomains).
	Overall, peer-to-peer connexions are established so so that 'command' is executed symmetrically and simultaneously on both sides of each worker pair. I.e. if worker "i" executes "command" with argument "j" (index of another worker), then by design "j" will execute the same thing with argument "i" *simultaneously*.

	In many cases a similar series of data exchanges can be obtained more simply (and fastly) with asynchronous irecv+send like below.

	for w in workers:
		m=comm.irecv(w)
		comm.send(data,dest=w)

	The above only works if the messages are all known in advance locally, before any communication. If the interaction with workers[1] depends on the result of a previous interaction with workers[0] OTOH, it needs synchronous execution, hence this function. Synchronicity is also required if more than one blocking call is present in 'command', else an obvious deadlock as if 'irecv' was replaced by 'recv' in that naive loop.
	Both cases occur with the 'medianFilter' algorithm, hence why we need this synchronous method.

	In this function pair connexions are established by the workers in a non-supervized and non-deterministic manner. Each time an interactive communication (i,j) is established 'command' is executed simultaneously by i and j. It is guaranted that all possible pairs are visited.

	The function can be used for all-to-all operations (N^2 pairs), but more interestingly it works with workers=intersections[rank] (O(N) pairs). It can be tested with the dummy funtion 'pairOp': runOnSynchronouslPairs(range(numThreads),pairOp)

	command:
		a function taking index of another worker as argument, can include blocking communications with the other worker since runOnSynchronouslPairs guarantee that the other worker will be running the command symmetrically.
